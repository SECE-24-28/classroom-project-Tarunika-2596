        <p>A paragraph is a distinct section of writing that focuses on a single idea or topic, 
            consisting of one or more sentences. It is used to organize writing and make it easier 
            for readers to follow, typically marked by an indentation or a blank line at the beginning. 
            Most paragraphs have a topic sentence that states the main idea, followed by supporting 
            sentences that elaborate on it. </p>
